# beast_ws_async_server

An example single-threaded asynchronous Websocket server written with [Beast](https://github.com/vinniefalco/Beast) as part of my Boost review of the library.

This is a simplified port of an existing embedded Websocket frontend to an existing TCP/IP-based custom application server.
